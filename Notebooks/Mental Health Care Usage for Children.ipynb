    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "  Depression and other forms of mental health disorders have infamously become more apparent over time, especially within the young, adolescent generation. This could be due to immense stress from numerous sources, overstimulation from social media, or lack of sleep from work, to name a few.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Being at a critical period in life where physical and mental growth takes its stride but is also extremely delicate, having such psychological factors could be detrimental to one’s development. I was left wondering whether or not any action have been or are being taken in response to this growing concern, and what factors may affect a child's need to reach out for help.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   As someone who takes therapy and has first-hand experience with its benefits, not only is this project an important topic to explore, but also a personal interest. Every time I finish each session feeling better & stronger and reflect back on the personal developments that I notice, I always wish that I sought for therapy sooner. Knowing its huge benefits and support (granted, in ideal situations, eg. when one’s therapist works well & has good chemistry with their patient, when the patient is willing to work with their therapist, and when there are little to no complications with having therapy like financial reasons, etc.), I couldn’t emphasize taking therapy more than it deserves."

    "### Why bother with this research?\n",
    "\n",
    " Throughout my search for online data, I was not able to stumble upon any research or references illustrating the use of mental health care over time. There are studies exploring the benefits of mental health care and growing trends with mental health disorders amongst adolescents, but none that focus on the growth or depletion of service over time. There are databases and a few published papers presenting the percent usage of mental health care by children, but only limited within a year or two. From this, I expected to find some paper looking at the same topic but over a longer time set, yet I failed to encounter any. Let alone, even simple Google searches such as “Have more kids been receiving therapy?” or “Percentage of children receiving therapy over time” yield no fruitful results other than clusters of web pages providing advice to parents seeking psychotherapy for their children or limited statistical runs from one year.\n",
    " \n",
    " In contrast to the other papers with the same topic, I instead will be looking at a longer course of time, as well as identifying interesting correlations and factors associated with reachout for mental health care."

    "\n",
    "As seen and explored later, each year's dataset has a large set of columns, representing a question from that year's survey. Some years may have unique questions not found on other years due to changes/updates in health protocols, or based on the years' national health priority concern. For example, the survey for 2020 may have questions regarding COVID-19, which would not be found in other years."

    "In this project, I will be looking at column variables/questions found universally in all 18 years. Although some years may contain interesting questions that deserve further investigation, it would be best to preserve a sustained perspective of change throughout all years in respect to the research question. We will be focusing most of our data analysis with the following column variable/question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**CHCSYR1 -  \"During the past 12 months, has your child seen or talked to a mental health professional?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is the most appropriate in regards to gauging the usage of mental health care for each year compared to the others. In relation to this question, I scanned through each year's Variable Summaries (found under *Data/sample_child_survey/summary*) and chose the following questions that I consider potentially direct/important factors affecting a child's reachout for help:\n",
    "\n",
    "**• SEX -  \"Is your child male or female?\"**\\\n",
    "**• RACERPI2 -  \"OMB Race Group\"**\\\n",
    "(Note: the question above does not include Hispanic or Latino as it's covered in another column asking for specific subgroup of Hispanic origin (HISPAN_I); due to the chance that some respondents are mixed, the HISPAN_I value will be converted to a boolean series, which will be performed during data cleaning)\\\n",
    "**• AGE_P -  \"How old is your child?\"**\\\n",
    "**• CHCAFYR2 -  \"During the past 12 months, was there any time when your child needed mental health care but didn't get it because you couldn't afford it?\"**\\\n",
    "**• CMDLONGR -  \"About how long has it been since anyone in the family last saw or talked to a doctor or health care professional about your child's health?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: There is an exception for the year 2004. For reasons that I myself do not know, numerous useful questions that are found in all other years have been excluded in 2004. There will be some datapoints in which 2004 will not be represented, however will be visible in others, such as **SEX** and **CHCSYR1**)\n",

    "## Conclusion/Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some take-home points\n",
    "\n",
    "• There has been an increase percentage of children receiving mental care/counseling over time, showing that mental health has become prominent throughout the years\\\n",
    "• Contrary to the stigma about males expressing emotion as a sign of weakness, more male children are receiving care\\\n",
    "• The visualization results shown in **RACERPI2 & HISPAN_I** could be due to a variety of reasons. The subculture of each respective race/ethnicity may undermine the value of mental health or view looking for help as \"shameful\"\\\n",
    "• The fact that more adolescents are looking for mental health care confirms the fact that depression and other mental disorders are becoming more prevalent within youth-hood. In addition, one can start looking for mental care/counseling earlier\\\n",
    "• Results from **CHCAFYR2** and **CMDLONGR** show the critical need for mental care/counseling, regardless of financial coverage or attendace of doctor visits (or that the survey could have taken better results)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to consider\n",
    "• All data is from survey results, so observations made throughout this project may not be accurate in describing the general population\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Most respondents were the childrens' parents/guardians\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Potential false/inaccurate inputs\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Survey population was small\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible future research\n",
    "• Exploration of other survey questions\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• MHIBOY2: Mental Health Indicator (boy)\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• CMHAGM25: Unhappy, sad, or depressed past 6 mon\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• NTRSAYR: Didn't get treatment or counseling because afraid of family/friends opinion\\\n",
    "• Overlapping the questions observed throughout this project (eg. looking at percentage of children who visited mental health professional by age AND race, etc.)\\\n",
    "• Expansion of project with machine learning, such as PCA or predicting future points\\\n",
    "• Grouping children with and without mental disorder\\\n",
    "• Request to have important questions from one year be asked in other years"
